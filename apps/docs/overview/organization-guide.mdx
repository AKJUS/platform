# Documentation Organization Guide

Welcome to the reorganized Tuturuuu documentation space. This guide explains the new structure so you can find information quickly and add new content with confidence.

## 🧭 Top-Level Map

| Section | Purpose | Key Entry Points |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Overview** | Vision, mission, and company playbooks | [Vision & Mission](/overview/vision) |
| **Platform** | Product experience, AI systems, shared components, personalization | [Platform Overview](/platform/index) |
| **Build** | Local setup, monorepo workflows, CI/CD | [Build & Ship](/build/index) |
| **Learn** | Examples, experiments, prompt engineering | [Learn & Experiment](/learn/index) |
| **Reference** | Stable APIs and integration contracts | [Reference Home](/reference/index) |

Each section contains focused subpages that keep related content together. Navigation in the sidebar follows this same hierarchy.

## 📂 Directory Layout

```text
apps/docs/
├── overview/             # Company vision and organizational guides
├── platform/             # Product experience, AI, components, personalization
├── build/                # Development tooling and workflows
├── learn/                # Examples, experiments, prompt engineering
└── reference/            # API contracts and schemas
```

Assets such as images remain in `apps/docs/images/`. Shared assets for navigation (logo, favicon) sit alongside `mint.json`.

## ✍️ Adding New Content

1. **Pick a Section** – Choose the directory that matches your topic. When in doubt, align with how end users will search for the information.
2. **Create the File** – Use front matter with `title`, `description`, and `updated` fields. Example:

   ```mdx
   ---
   title: 'My Guide'
   description: 'Brief purpose statement.'
   updated: '2025-09-26'
   ---
   ```
3. **Cross-Link Thoughtfully** – Prefer absolute links such as `/platform/features/command-center-dashboard` so moves do not break references.
4. **Update Navigation** – Add the new page to `apps/docs/mint.json` in the appropriate group.

## ✅ Conventions to Remember

- **Navigation** mirrors the directory layout; keep related pages together.
- **Diagrams** use Mermaid 10.8.0 syntax.
- **Images** belong in `apps/docs/images/` and are referenced with absolute paths (`/images/...`).
- **Docs Linting** relies on Biome; run formatting and lint checks before submitting changes.

Need inspiration for structuring a new guide? Browse the [Platform Overview](/platform/index) and [Build & Ship](/build/index) pages—they demonstrate the preferred narrative pattern (context → diagrams → next steps).

If anything feels missing or confusing, open an issue with the `docs` label so we can continue improving the experience together.
