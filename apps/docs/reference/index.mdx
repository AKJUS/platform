# Reference

This section collects stable contracts—APIs, schemas, and integration guides.

## Available References

- **AI Endpoint** – Review request and response schemas for the [Generate API](/reference/api-reference/endpoint/generate).

More reference material will appear here as we stabilize additional interfaces. If you need implementation guides, jump to [Build](/build/index); for product tours, explore [Platform](/platform/index).
