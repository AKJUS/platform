# Learn & Experiment

Level up your Tuturuuu expertise through curated examples, experiments, and prompt engineering playbooks.

## Learning Paths

- **Examples** – Browse practical snippets and starter code in the [Examples Library](/learn/examples/index).
- **Experiments** – Explore in-progress ideas in [Experiments](/learn/experiments/form-builder) to understand what is coming next.
- **Prompt Engineering** – Master AI collaboration with the [Prompt Engineering Guides](/learn/prompt-engineering/introduction).

## Experimentation Flow

    participant Idea
    participant Prototype
    participant Feedback
    participant Product

    Idea->>Prototype: Rapid build (Examples + Tooling)
    Prototype->>Feedback: Share with community & team
    Feedback->>Product: Promote validated ideas
    Product-->>Examples: Feed learnings back into docs
```

Stay curious—share findings, improve docs, and help us expand what the Tuturuuu ecosystem can do. For detailed platform architecture, visit the [Platform section](/platform/index). Need local tooling help? Return to [Build](/build/index).
