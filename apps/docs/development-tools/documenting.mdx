<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: You should have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
  (version 20 or higher) and cloned the [Tuturuuu
  Monorepo](https://github.com/tutur3u/platform) to your local machine.
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your local machine:

<CodeGroup>

```bash bun
bun i -g mintlify
```

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (navigate to `apps/docs`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

<Tip>Use `cd apps/docs` to navigate to the docs folder.</Tip>

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash bun
bun i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

## Writing Documentation

### File Structure

Each documentation file should follow this structure:

```mdx
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "Brief description of the page content"
updatedAt: "YYYY-MM-DD"
---

# Page Title

Content goes here...
```

### Content Guidelines

1. **Use clear headings** to structure your content
2. **Include code examples** with proper syntax highlighting
3. **Add cross-references** to related documentation
4. **Keep content up-to-date** by updating the `updatedAt` field
5. **Use consistent formatting** throughout

### Code Examples

When including code examples:

- Use proper syntax highlighting
- Include TypeScript types
- Show both server and client examples
- Include error handling
- Test examples before committing

### Images and Assets

- Store images in the `images/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames
- Optimize images for web
- Include alt text for accessibility

## Contributing

### Before You Start

1. Check if documentation already exists
2. Look for similar patterns in existing docs
3. Follow the established structure
4. Read the [Organization Guide](../organization-guide) for structure

### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch** for your documentation changes
2. **Write clear, concise content** that's easy to understand
3. **Include practical examples** that developers can use
4. **Update related documentation** if needed
5. **Test your changes** locally with `mintlify dev`

### Review Process

1. **Self-review** your changes for clarity and accuracy
2. **Check links** to ensure they work correctly
3. **Verify code examples** are correct and complete
4. **Update the table of contents** if adding new sections
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

## Best Practices

### Writing Style

- **Be concise** but comprehensive
- **Use active voice** when possible
- **Write for your audience** (developers)
- **Include context** for complex topics
- **Use consistent terminology** throughout

### Organization

- **Group related content** together
- **Use clear section headings**
- **Include a table of contents** for long pages
- **Cross-reference** related documentation
- **Keep examples practical** and realistic

### Maintenance

- **Update documentation** when APIs change
- **Remove outdated information** promptly
- **Keep examples current** with latest versions
- **Review documentation regularly** for accuracy
- **Ask for feedback** from other developers
