# Calendar Component Improvements

## Overview

This update consolidates the previously separate `EventModal` and `GenerateEventModal` into a unified `UnifiedEventModal` component. The new implementation provides a better user experience with a tabbed interface that allows users to:

1. Manually create and edit events
2. Generate events using AI
3. Preview and save AI-generated events

## Key Components

### UnifiedEventModal

The main component that combines both manual event creation/editing and AI-generated event functionality. It features:

- Tabbed interface with notebook-style tabs for better visual clarity
- Spacious, clean layout with proper spacing and alignment
- Fixed header and footer with scrollable content area
- Optimized datetime selection with side-by-side layout
- Smart scheduling to avoid conflicts
- Overlap detection and warnings
- Enhanced preview experience for AI-generated events
- Accordion-based advanced settings for progressive disclosure
- Reliable scrolling with explicit height constraints

### EventFormComponents

A collection of reusable form components that are used in the UnifiedEventModal:

- `EventTitleInput`: For event title
- `EventDescriptionInput`: For event description
- `EventLocationInput`: For event location
- `EventDateTimePicker`: For date and time selection
- `EventColorPicker`: For event color selection
- `EventPriorityPicker`: For event priority selection
- `EventToggleSwitch`: For toggle switches (all-day, multi-day)
- `FormSection`: For organizing form sections
- `OverlapWarning`: For displaying overlap warnings
- `DateError`: For displaying date validation errors
- `EventActionButtons`: For form action buttons

## UX/UI Improvements

### Notebook-Style Interface

- Redesigned tabs to resemble notebook tabs for better visual clarity
- Active tab appears connected to the content area
- Provides clear visual indication of the current tab
- More intuitive navigation between different modes

### Fixed Header and Footer with Reliable Scrolling

- Header and footer remain fixed while content scrolls
- Action buttons are always accessible at the bottom of the modal
- Properly implemented ScrollArea with explicit height constraints
- Fixed display issues with tabs to ensure proper rendering
- Ensures content is always accessible and scrollable regardless of length

### Progressive Disclosure with Accordions

- Advanced settings are now tucked away in expandable accordions
- Reduces visual complexity by showing only essential fields by default
- Users can access advanced options when needed
- Provides a cleaner, more focused interface for common tasks

### Optimized Layout for Datetime Selection

- Datetime selectors are displayed side-by-side for better space utilization
- All-day and multi-day toggles are positioned in the header of the datetime section
- Provides more horizontal space for the datetime pickers
- Improves readability and usability

### Clean, Spacious Design

- Increased spacing between elements for better readability
- Reduced visual clutter by removing unnecessary backgrounds and borders
- Used subtle separators to define different sections
- Improved alignment and consistency throughout the interface

### Enhanced Event Preview

- Redesigned event preview with a cleaner, more readable layout
- Better organization of event details with clear visual hierarchy
- Improved date and time display with separate date and time lines
- Priority badge moved to the header for better visibility
- Proper scrolling for long event descriptions

### Improved AI Experience

- Cleaner AI form with more space for the prompt input
- Better organized AI settings with clear labels and descriptions
- Enhanced visual feedback during loading and error states
- More intuitive flow between AI generation and preview
- Advanced AI settings tucked away in an accordion

## Usage

The UnifiedEventModal is integrated into the Calendar component and is triggered by the CreateEventButton. The modal adapts its interface based on whether a new event is being created or an existing event is being edited.

```jsx
<CalendarProvider>
  <div className="flex h-full flex-col">
    {/* Calendar components */}

    {disabled ? null : (
      <>
        <UnifiedEventModal />
        <CreateEventButton />
      </>
    )}
  </div>
</CalendarProvider>
```
