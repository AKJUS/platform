  - Batch configuration validation
  - Integration with `syncWorkspaceExtendedBatched`

## Test Categories

### **Integration Tests**
Tests that verify the new batched functions are properly integrated into existing sync workflows:

```typescript
describe('Integration with syncWorkspaceExtendedBatched', () => {
  it('should call syncWorkspaceExtendedBatched when events exist', async () => {
    // Tests that the new batched function is called instead of the old one
  });

  it('should not call syncWorkspaceExtendedBatched when no events exist', async () => {
    // Tests that no sync is called when there are no events
  });

  it('should handle batched sync errors gracefully', async () => {
    // Tests error handling in the new batched implementation
  });
});
```

### **Batch Processing Tests**
Tests that verify the batch processing logic works correctly:

```typescript
describe('syncGoogleCalendarEventsForWorkspaceBatched', () => {
  it('should process events in batches for upserts', async () => {
    // Tests that events are processed in chunks of BATCH_SIZE (100)
  });

  it('should process events in batches for deletes', async () => {
    // Tests that deletions are processed in chunks of DELETE_BATCH_SIZE (50)
  });

  it('should handle mixed events (confirmed and cancelled)', async () => {
    // Tests that both upserts and deletes work together
  });
});
```

### **Error Handling Tests**
Tests that verify proper error handling in batch operations:

```typescript
it('should handle upsert errors gracefully', async () => {
  // Mock error as Error object (not string)
  mockSupabaseClient.from.mockReturnValue({
    upsert: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ error: new Error('Upsert failed') })),
    // ...
  });
  
  const result = await syncGoogleCalendarEventsForWorkspaceBatched(ws_id, events);
  
  expect(result).toEqual({
    ws_id: 'test-workspace',
    success: false,
    error: 'Upsert failed', // Error message extracted from Error object
  });
});

it('should handle delete errors gracefully', async () => {
  // Mock error as Error object (not string)
  mockSupabaseClient.from.mockReturnValue({
    delete: vi.fn(() => ({
      or: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ error: new Error('Delete failed') }))
    }))
  });
  
  const result = await syncGoogleCalendarEventsForWorkspaceBatched(ws_id, events);
  
  expect(result).toEqual({
    ws_id: 'test-workspace',
    success: false,
    error: 'Delete failed', // Error message extracted from Error object
  });
});
```

**Important Note**: The batched sync function expects Error objects, not strings. The error handling extracts the message from Error instances using `error.message`, otherwise it returns "Unknown error".

### **Performance Tests**
Tests that verify batch processing works with large datasets:

```typescript
it('should process large batches correctly', async () => {
  // Tests with 150+ events to verify multiple batch processing
});

it('should process large delete batches correctly', async () => {
  // Tests with 75+ cancelled events to verify multiple delete batches
});
```

## Mock Structure

### **Supabase Client Mock**
```typescript
const mockSupabaseClient = {
  from: vi.fn(() => ({
    upsert: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ error: null as any })),
    delete: vi.fn(() => ({
      or: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ error: null as any }))
    }))
  }))
};
```

### **Function Mocks**
```typescript
syncWorkspaceExtendedBatched: vi.fn((payload) => Promise.resolve({
  ws_id: payload.ws_id,
  success: true,
  eventsSynced: payload.events_to_sync?.length || 10,
  eventsDeleted: 0,
}))
```

## Test Coverage Areas

### **1. Batch Size Configuration**
- Tests verify that `BATCH_SIZE = 100` is used for upserts
- Tests verify that `DELETE_BATCH_SIZE = 50` is used for deletes
- Tests verify multiple batch calls for large datasets

### **2. Event Processing**
- Tests verify events are properly separated into upserts and deletes
- Tests verify mixed event types are handled correctly
- Tests verify empty event arrays are handled gracefully

### **3. Database Operations**
- Tests verify upsert operations are called with correct parameters
- Tests verify delete operations are called with correct conditions
- Tests verify error handling for database operations

### **4. Error Handling**
- Tests verify that individual batch errors don't affect other batches
- Tests verify that errors are properly propagated
- Tests verify that error messages are meaningful

### **5. Integration**
- Tests verify that existing sync workflows use the new batched functions
- Tests verify that locale functionality is preserved
- Tests verify that sync token handling is maintained

## Configuration Constants Tested

### **Batch Sizes**
```typescript
const BATCH_SIZE = 100; // Process 100 events at a time for upserts
const DELETE_BATCH_SIZE = 50; // Process 50 events at a time for deletes
```

### **Test Scenarios**
- **Small Batches**: 1-50 events (single batch)
- **Medium Batches**: 51-100 events (multiple batches)
- **Large Batches**: 100+ events (multiple batches)
- **Mixed Operations**: Both upserts and deletes in same sync

## Migration Testing

### **Backward Compatibility**
- Tests verify that existing functions still work
- Tests verify that new functions can be used alongside old ones
- Tests verify that function signatures remain compatible

### **Performance Validation**
- Tests verify that batch processing reduces database calls
- Tests verify that error isolation works as expected
- Tests verify that memory usage is optimized

## Running the Tests

### **Individual Test Files**
```bash
# Run full sync tests
npm test google-calendar-full-sync.test.ts

# Run incremental sync tests
npm test google-calendar-incremental-sync.test.ts

# Run batched sync tests
npm test google-calendar-batched-sync.test.ts

# Run locale functionality tests
npm test locale-functionality.test.ts

# Run all tests in the trigger package
npm test
```

## Expected Test Results

### **Passing Tests**
- All integration tests should pass
- All batch processing tests should pass
- All error handling tests should pass
- All performance tests should pass

### **Test Metrics**
- **Coverage**: >90% for new batch functions
- **Performance**: Batch operations should be faster than single operations
- **Reliability**: Error handling should prevent cascading failures

## Future Test Enhancements

### **1. Load Testing**
- Add tests with 1000+ events
- Add tests with concurrent batch operations
- Add tests with memory pressure scenarios

### **2. Edge Case Testing**
- Add tests with malformed event data
- Add tests with network timeouts
- Add tests with database connection failures

### **3. Monitoring Tests**
- Add tests for batch processing metrics
- Add tests for performance monitoring
- Add tests for error rate tracking

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the batch deletion implementation is robust, reliable, and performs well under various conditions.
